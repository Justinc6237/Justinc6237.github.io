This week we had to make alot of contracts. We used code.pyret to be able to make the contracts. This week really showed my my struggles. It showed me that i need alot of more help making contracts. It also made me realize the meaning of a contract. I always felt that contracts we pointles and they wasnt needed. But then i realized that the contract is meaningful because it makes us understand thye definition that we are producing.We worked on Function Practice to be able to figure out contracts. I barley got any done but that helps me with knowing that i need help with contracts.
