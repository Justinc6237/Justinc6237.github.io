This week we started on making flag collages again. This time e needed more information about the flag. I had the swaeden flag. its blue and have a yellow crose. The blue meaurments go from 4:5 blue 2:2 yellow and 4:9 blue again. Not everyone was constructed. This lead to a class discution on how the class should be for the remaining og the year. We talked about how much more we need to work on and learn about.
