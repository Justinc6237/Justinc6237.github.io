This is our final submition of our flag collage. ![myflag](/images/sweg.png) while i was working on this i had many questions. Questions such as, what is the right mesurment? and the other question is how will i murge the colors together. If u saw my flag i did ont out of the two. Next week lets see if i can find the answer to both.
