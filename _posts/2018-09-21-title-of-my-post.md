This week we are still trying trying to continue to understand making functions and definitions. Where still working on our comtratcs. And we are understanding why contracts are important. They are important because they help us understand with out the contracts we wouldnt be able to figure out what is inside the perentices that is used inside the contract that would lead to the definition. We did alot of other things to like we made a table. In the table we used data. Within this data we used string Nukber and Boolean in order to make the table.
