## Flag of _insert your country_ by _insert your name_

## Describe your program

-   The flag that i decided to make if Sweaden 
-   The flag i chose is a low grade flag. But i put on effert on this flag and it took me time to be able to get the right effort



## Current output


* * *
![Flag](/images/bep.png)
* * *

## Describe your process.

-   There was many questions that i had asked my self threw out this proccess. I asked my self was how would i be able to get the right cordnets, how will i mugre three colors to be able to make one flag, how would i imporve my steps everytime i log into code.pyret




## Explain your code.

include image


pep=rectangle(300,200,"solid","royal-blue")

rep=rectangle(50,200,"solid","yellow")

cep=(place-image(rep,100,100,pep))

sep=rectangle(4000,50,"solid","yellow")

bep=(place-image(sep,100,100,cep))
-   I used the 200 as the y axis so the flag dont have to be to big nore to small. 300 had to be the x axis for the width. The rep would be the way the yellow striped goes more horizontal. The cep is for the other yellow stripped to go verical. in able for there to be a cross that follows the type of flag that i made. Sep is the way that i had answered my question on how i will be able to murge the three codes into one.
